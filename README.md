# Ship-Crew-Prediction-Regression
**Author**: Rupert Hart

**Date**: 18/07/2022

We used Linear Regression to build a simple model using the cruise_ship_info.csv data set for predicting a ship's crew size. The project was split into the following sections: 
- EDA and Variable Selection.
- Build a simple OLS Linear Model (without any automation / Pipelines etc.). 
- Build an automated Pipeline to train and OLS and Ridge regression model and to tune hyperparamters. 
- Perform a nested cross validation and select the best performing model. 


**cruise_ship_info.csv**: dataset used for model building.

**Ship_crew_regression.ipynb**: the jupyter notebook containing code.
